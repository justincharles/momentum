title: "DSA Momentum Supports Resolution #46"
---

DSA needs more (and better!) internal arenas for political discussion and debate. That's why we support convention Resolution #46 motivated by Gabrielle Semel and Dave Hancock, both of NYC-DSA. It calls for the establishment of discussion bulletins, chapter discussions and trainings, regular conference calls, and other measures to organize discussion on the major political issues facing DSA. We call on all delegates attending the convention to vote for it!

The full text of Resolution #46 is below:

#### Resolution

The new NPC shall organize a discussion in the organization of the issues raised by documents produced by slates and semi-slates for the NPC (Momentum, Praxis, Unity Through Diversity).

#### Motivation

DSA has grown tremendously over the last two years.  In 2015, DSA membership nationwide was 6,500.  It is now 24,000.  DSA’s growth is not the simple addition of new members by ones and twos, but an explosive reaction to the times.  DSA grew tremendously out of the Bernie Sanders campaign and even more so after Donald Trump won the presidency.

Along with rapidly changing political times come many new and important political questions that the organization must address.  Credit must be given to the newly formed slates and semi-slates for the NPC for raising some of these questions, however the convention does not provide for discussion of these documents, nor should it so late in the process.  These ideas have not been discussed in the branches and thus bringing them into the convention without prior branch discussion would not be democratic.

One of DSA’s strengths is that we are a multi-tendency organization that welcomes  diverse socialist perspectives and viewpoints.  That diversity should not be a barrier to serious political discussion, but should enhance it.   We should create a process for discussing important political questions to strengthen our analysis, vision and strategy.

Our resolution calls for the NPC to organize discussions throughout DSA through discussion bulletins, chapter discussions, trainings, conference calls and/or other ways they deem appropriate.  Specifically we identify the following issues that should be discussed: electoral politics, the labor movement, mass coalition work, national training, internal democracy, supporting the struggles of oppressed peoples, and transforming DSA into a more diverse working class based organization.

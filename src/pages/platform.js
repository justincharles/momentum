                There can be no socialist movement without a strong and militant
                workers’ movement. Major changes in the structure of the global
                economy have not invalidated the basic insights of socialist
                politics – they have simply reshaped the battleground of class
                conflict. Unfortunately, labor movements in the US and around
                the world have struggled mightily to adapt to these shifts.
                While there are signs that a new upswing in working class
                organization and struggle may be on the horizon, after thirty
                years of unrelenting attack labor’s position remains weak and
                insecure.

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                Labor’s dire condition is, to a significant extent, a result of
                forces beyond its control. At the same time, the dominant
                strategic orientation among the union leadership – often
                described as “business unionism” – has proven itself to be
                utterly incapable of combating capital’s war on the power and
                living standards of the working class.

                What is the role of a socialist organization in the labor
                movement today? We argue that the current situation leaves us
                with one choice: the adoption of a rank-and-file strategy. The
                rank-and-file strategy is the most promising path for reviving
                the unions that still exist (e.g. the Chicago Teachers Union)
                and organizing the vast majority of unorganized workers. It is
                also the best and most effective way for socialists to root
                ourselves in the working class, avoid sectarian isolation, and
                build the social power working people need to win fundamental
                political change.
              </p>

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                Simply put, there is no socialist movement without a strong
                labor movement rooted in the power of rank-and-file workers.
                Without a strong base in the workers’ movement, there is little
                that distinguishes DSA or any other socialist group from the
                wide array of single-issue activist groups and foundation-funded
                nonprofit organizations. It is the key to building an
                independent base of social power that can effectively fight
                employers in the workplace; support the creation of a new
                socialist political formation; and hold our politicians
                accountable to our goals once they are elected to office. It
                would also be the most effective way to diversify our membership
                base along the lines of class, gender, race, ethnicity, and
                national origin. Unions, for all their problems, are among the
                most integrated institutions because they have to organize
                whomever the boss hires in order to be effective. The working
                class is the most diverse part of our society – if we want to
                change the demographic composition of DSA, this is where we must
                go.

                If elected to the NPC, we will work to develop a national
                program that encourages DSA locals around the country to adopt
                and implement the rank-and-file strategy. This will entail
                intensive political education in the thinking behind the
                strategy; an analysis of the most strategic sectors and
                occupations for DSA members to enter; and the creation of a
                support network for DSA members who choose to do this work. Our
                view is that this program should focus on three main strategic
                “industries”: education, health care, and
                logistics/distribution. These fields are critical nodes in
                today’s economy; offer opportunities to both rebuild existing
                unions and organize the unorganized; and give rank-and-file
                socialist organizers the chance to build power while living a
                decent life.

                The deep crisis of US labor may offer hidden advantages to
                socialists practicing the rank-and-file strategy. The so-called
                “right-to-work” drive will throw the big and bureaucratic public
                sector unions into turmoil, and expose the weaknesses of
                incumbent labor leaderships who can’t – or won’t – fight back.
                Despite the massive challenges confronting labor activists
                today, socialists will have new opportunities to fight for
                positions of leadership in the labor movement, and to lay the
                groundwork for a new upsurge of working class struggle. We have
                no choice but to seize them.

                Electoral Strategy, Not Electoralism
              </h4>
              <p className="main__paragraph">
                Socialism will not come through the ballot box alone, but
                developing a socialist electoral strategy is one of the key
                tasks for our organization today. Historically, socialists in
                the US have tended to adopt one of three main types of electoral
                strategies: realignment, the “inside/outside” approach, and
                independent political action.
              </p>

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                Under the realignment strategy, socialists sought to unite all
                progressive forces in the Democratic Party and drive all
                reactionary forces into the Republican Party, with the intention
                of turning the Democrats into the equivalent of a western
                European social democratic or labor party. This was the strategy
                DSA founder Michael Harrington advocated from the 1960s through
                the 1980s, and it was DSA’s dominant orientation for much of its
                history. While we reject this strategy as inappropriate to the
                current political situation, it had the merit of being based on
                a critical analysis of potential points of leverage in the party
                system issuing from splits within the ruling class over major
                political issues. In previous decades, there were real conflicts
                between major wings of the Democratic Party coalition over key
                questions such as civil rights. It made sense to work to
                intensify contradictions between northern liberals and Southern
                Dixiecrats and push the latter into the Republican Party. This
                realignment did in fact happen, but it did not result in the
                transformation of the Democrats into a social democratic party.
                Instead, the party recruited a layer of culturally liberal
                members of the professional-managerial class that now constitute
                a core component of the party’s social base. Today we are faced
                with a partisan alignment that does not offer much room in
                either party for the socialist left, and which does not seem
                conducive to moving any major bloc from one party into the
                other.
              </p>

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                The inside/outside strategy also attempts to work within the
                two-party system, but in a different manner from the realignment
                strategy. The “inside” part of the strategy is similar to that
                the realignment approach: socialists are encouraged to run as
                Democrats and agitate and organize within the party for a
                leftward shift. The inside game would be supplemented by
                organizing and agitation outside the party system through
                non-electoral social movement pressure. Advocates of this
                approach, however, tend to leave the question of the proper
                balance of inside and outside work unaddressed. This results in
                a high level of ambiguity as to what exactly this strategy
                should look like in practice and what its long-term aims are.
              </p>

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                Finally, there is the strategy of independent political action.
                Its advocates reject working within the two party system
                altogether, and argue for the establishment of an independent
                socialist, labor, or people’s party.
              </p>

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                We find all three of these approaches to be strategically
                limited. Realignment has been attempted multiple times
                throughout US history, and the results have fallen far short of
                expectations at every turn. Insurgent candidates are pushed in
                practice toward the political center, as they have to campaign
                for all Democratic candidates and are expected to maintain party
                discipline in legislative voting. Wealthy donors give moderates
                and centrists a major advantage in intra-party conflicts,
                regardless of the wishes of many Democratic voters. These
                structural limitations severely constrain even the most
                well-meaning and politically savvy insurgents who want to turn
                the Democrats into a legitimate labor or social democratic
                party.
              </p>

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                The inside/outside strategy rightly recognizes the barriers to
                realignment, and advocates a guerilla warfare-style engagement
                with the Democratic Party. It too, however, does not offer a
                fully satisfactory approach to electoral politics. While
                pressure from the outside may help to push Democratic
                officeholders to support reforms in periods of political and
                economic crisis (e.g. the 1930s and 1960s), these gains will
                inevitably be rolled back with the support of Democratic
                politicians when the political winds shift and Democratic
                politicians face electoral costs by continuing to support
                social-democratic reforms. Because it doesn’t aim to build an
                internally democratic and member-driven mass party capable of
                holding officeholders accountable to its agenda, the
                inside/outside strategy is highly vulnerable in periods of
                relative social movement inactivity, and risks lapsing into
                realignment by another name.
              </p>

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                Yet calls to “leave the party” and found a new formation right
                now seem to misunderstand the unique nature of the US electoral
                system. As we have seen time and again, third parties are
                structurally hobbled by the a peculiar combination of single
                round, first-part-the-post voting for legislative offices; a
                strongly presidential system of government; and draconian
                electoral laws designed to protect the two main parties from
                meaningful competition. Simply leaving the party without an
                alternative strategy in place will produce little more than
                quickly forgotten insurgent campaigns.
              </p>

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                We believe that any viable electoral strategy for building a
                mass left-wing formation in the US must be based on a
                recognition of these realities. Where possible, we should
                attempt to use the major parties’ ballot lines without
                confronting the major parties’ infrastructure. This is not to
                say that we can simply “enter” these parties and wield them for
                our own ends. We reject the realignment strategy on precisely
                this basis.
              </p>

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                Rather, we propose an approach that could be called building a
                “party beyond the party,” one that formulates a clear political
                program and develops, runs, and disciplines candidates in select
                campaigns. If candidates are not organically linked and held
                accountable to a strong political organization, office-holders
                of any political party will betray their electoral base for
                political expediency. Wherever possible, especially in cities
                and states dominated by the Democratic Party, we will seek to
                run candidates on an independent, openly socialist basis.
                However, the choice of ballot line is secondary to the strength
                of a political organization that can develop candidates and hold
                them accountable once in office.
              </p>
              <p className="main__paragraph">
                Any socialist organization must engage in electoral politics.
                But we must avoid the trap of electoralism (an excessive focus
                on election campaigns) while doing so. Campaigning for public
                office complements our work of building social power, and is not
                a substitute for it. Also, this strategy should be built very
                carefully and patiently. We believe that DSA’s current approach
                to running candidates lacks a truly strategic orientation, and
                requires a comprehensive rethinking. This will not happen
                overnight.

                responsibility. A strong movement for socialism in our country

                order their societies how they see fit, without the political

                with the moribund Socialist International (SI), which will not
                be the vehicle for such a project. DSA should begin to develop
                stronger relationships with new left parties and movements

                New York City and Philadelphia is based on traditional labor
                organizing structures (i.e. shop stewards) to develop an
                organized layer of activists between the membership and elected
                leaders. Mobilizers are trained to teach new members how the
                chapter works, share opportunities for participating in
                committees and campaigns, and relay member interests and
                concerns back to the elected leadership. We want to establish a
                national DSA Mobilizers program to support locals across the
                country looking to develop their own internal organizing
                capacity.

                to the DSA Constitution creates a mechanism whereby 20% of
                locals or 8% of members can petition the NPC to take up an
                important issue and hold an open debate, with reports back to
                the membership. This will give members a much greater say in the
                running the national organization between conventions, while
                increasing transparency and helping keep NPC accountable to
                members and locals. The process of petitioning and publicly
                debating issues across locals will foster a culture of internal
                organizing, debate, and transparency. It should also contribute
                to our internal political education work by developing members’
                capacity to formulate and argue for their ideas in a democratic
                setting.

              <p className="main__platform-subsection">
                Many DSAers are actively engaged in political debates in various
                places, whether in person, in print, or online. But DSA
                currently lacks any central forum for sustained
                organization-wide debate around key strategic and theoretical
                questions. Our various publications (Democratic Left, the
                Democratic Left blog, Talking Union, etc.) offer important
                updates on DSA’s organizing work and provide useful analyses of
                various political questions from DSAers and fellow travelers.
                But none allow DSAers with different strategic and tactical
                perspectives to engage each other publicly. This both inhibits
                the degree of internal democracy within DSA and limits our
                capacity for effective organizational decision-making.
              </p>
              <p className="main__platform-subsection">
                We propose a monthly or bimonthly internal discussion bulletin
                that curates key debates within DSA and offers a public forum
                that all DSA members can access. We also propose quarterly
                debates around DSA’s highest-priority strategic questions. These
                could consist of recorded debates involving a small group of DSA
                leaders representing specific points of view, and with extended
                Q & A based on questions from DSA members.

              <p className="main__platform-subsection">
                DSA should develop an annual process of organization-wide
                strategy discussions leading up national meetings. This process
                would consist of monthly conference calls or videoconferences on
                a different strategic or theoretical question each month for the
                4-6 months leading up to a national meeting. All DSA leaders and
                activists will be encouraged to participate on the calls, and
                would be provided with key background readings and questions for
                discussion leading up to each set of calls. These calls would
                culminate in state or regional-level meetups where members from
                a given geographical area can come together to discuss and
                debate the key issues coming out of the calls.

              <p className="main__platform-subsection">
                DSA prides itself on being a multi-tendency political
                organization, but for most of its history it has actively
                discouraged the development of distinct political tendencies
                within DSA. We understand concerns over the potential
                divisiveness they might produce, as well as the feeling that
                political and theoretical debates could distract from the
                business of organizing. In the absence of of organized
                tendencies, key political questions are resolved largely based
                on staff and elected leaders interpreting what the “mainstream”
                political views of DSA are. The result is that strategic
                differences within the organization are rarely discussed openly
                and explicitly. This limits understanding among DSA’s membership
                about the key issues facing the organization, and limited
                coherence in DSA’s political decision-making. If elected, we
                will work to facilitate the development of organized political
                caucuses in the organization that will provide space for members
                to develop their political perspectives, and perform the
                valuable function of assembling the wide range of political
                views in the membership into a set of coherent tendencies.

              <p className="main__platform-subsection">
                Article 7 of the DSA Constitution establishes a “National
                Activist Conference” to be held in off years between DSA’s

                  National Political Committee, Chairs of Commissions, the
                  Honorary Chairs and Vice-Chairs, two delegates selected by
                  each Local, and any additional DSA members who want to attend.

                The national activist conference has not been held in decades,
                so the biennial national convention is the only chance for
                members to gather across the organization. This places an undue
                burden on the biannual convention to do too many things -
                organizing trainings, convention proceedings, socializing time
                etc. - over a single weekend. We propose to bring back the
                national activist conference, which would focus on organizing
                training and political education, so the biennial convention can
                provide enough time to conduct a proper convention.

              <p className="main__platform-subsection">
                Many DSA chapters have language in their bylaws stating that
                members who are disciplined locally or who have their membership
                revoked by their local chapter have the right to appeal that
                decision to the national organization. However, there is
                currently no process or body specifically dedicated to review
                and respond to these local situations. In the long term, we
                would like to see DSA fund national grievance staff position for
                a national grievance staffer to help locals manage their own
                internal grievances and also to step in where asked by the local
                or in cases where members appeal disciplinary decisions made
                locally. As socialists committed to a future where socially
                necessary but unpleasant labor is justly compensated, we think
                it is critical that our shared organizational resources are used
                to compensate this work so that it is not informally pushed down
                onto our women members and care-taking personalities, who
                disproportionately resolve these grievances at the expense of
                their political engagement in the organization.
              </p>
              <p className="main__platform-subsection">
                Our Grievances proposal seeks to do four things. First, it
                explicitly empowers the National Political Committee to enforce
                a grievance and/or mediation procedure on members and locals.
                Second, it requires locals to have both a democratically elected
                Grievance Officer, as well as a local grievance procedure.
                Third, it requires the National Political Committee, in
                consultation with members and locals, to develop a guidelines
                for handling grievances at the local and national level. Fourth,
                it calls on the National Political Committee to hire a national
                grievance officer who will assist members and locals in handling
                grievances.

                To make the most of our recent growth and keep the momentum
                going, and in order to carry out ambitious plans like a national
                Medicare For All campaign, DSA needs to expand its operations in
                a big way. Conferences and trainings, regional offices,
                organizers, national political education, and materials all cost
                money. There is a real possibility that many of the new members
                who joined after Trump’s election last year won’t renew their
                annual membership when it expires. This would reduce the
                organization’s income, forcing us to cut back at a time when we
                should be expanding. Therefore, we support the proposed
                constitutional amendment to implement a monthly dues system.

                behavior, or the most previous experience in social movements
                become the “natural,” unquestioned leaders of the organization.
                We want to ensure that every member has the tools and knowledge
                to become a leader, someone with a voice in internal debates

                Our political vision is also one of the most important things

                activist organizations and foundation-funded nonprofits that
                have dominated the US left in recent decades. DSA is not just
                another activist group that happens to call ourselves socialist.
                Our socialist politics are at the core of our organization’s
                project, and everything we do must flow from that.

              <p className="main__paragraph">
                This applies most urgently to the production of socialist
                antiracist analysis. The cynical use of identity politics by the
                Clinton campaign reinforced in the popular imagination an
                artificial divide between “economic” issues embodied by the
                Bernie campaign and “social” issues pertaining to race, gender,
                sexuality, etc. This has hardened the idea that it is
                impossible, or even offensive, to talk about the material basis
                and consequences of racism. It has suffocated the development of
                an organic, independent socialist rhetoric around race. As it
                is, much of our antiracist discourse uses the exact vocabulary
                and tropes of “identitarian” discourse, slapped awkwardly onto a
                class-struggle narrative. It ends up sounding like an
                after-the-fact add-on rather than a seamless element of our
                analysis. This is a shame, because our chapters nationally have
                been throwing themselves into racial and economic justice across
                the country. Our activism shows that we know and feel how
                antiracism is a central terrain in the class struggle. We just
                have trouble expressing it, and that “rhetoric gap” is sensed by
                the same audiences to which we’re trying to speak. As we deepen
                our work for racial justice we also must deepen our
                understanding of how that work fits into our wider struggle.

                A number of DSA locals are doing important and inspiring work in
                support of universal health coverage in their cities and states,
                but these efforts are currently fragmented and uncoordinated. A
                nationally-coordinated approach would increase collaboration
                across chapters, provide chapters with resources to build their
                organizing capacities, and open the door to working
                relationships with all sorts of potential coalition partners.
                The campaign gives every chapter an opportunity to work with
                unions or other community partners on tangible, strategic
                campaign that build mutual trust. And it would plug chapters in
                states where single payer legislation is not viable into a
                national, organization-wide effort for Medicare for All.

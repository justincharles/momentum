title: "DSA Momentum Endorses Joe Schwartz for NPC"
---

DSA Momentum candidates have known and worked with Joe Schwartz for years. While we don't always agree with him on every political question, our respect and affection for Joe is unqualified. For decades, he's poured his heart and soul into building DSA and the broader socialist movement, and we've all learned a lot from him. These last few decades have not been kind to the socialist left, but Joe was there during the lean years to help keep our organization going. He carried the torch of socialist politics through some dark times, and his efforts are a big reason why DSA was in a position to become the organization it is today. We endorse Joe's candidacy and encourage delegates to cast one of their votes for him. Our candidates look forward to working with Joe to keep DSA's socialist politics at the heart of everything we do, and to build on the tremendous gains we've made over the last year.
